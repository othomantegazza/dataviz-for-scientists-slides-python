## Wiliam Playfair (1759 – 1823)

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="37%"}
In [his words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Playfair), commenting on how data were becoming ever more aboundant in life, and how data visualization (statistical diagrams) could help:

*"And it is hoped,that with the assistance of these Charts, such information will be got,
without the fatigue and trouble of studying the particulars of which it is composed."*

Maybe we've always known how to represent information visually, because that's the first and most intuitive way to do it.

## Abstraction

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="45%"}
### Visual display of information

The graphical display of information, of words, of stories, of topology, has been part of human history as soon as the first pictures on rocks where drawn; and we know that they date back at least 50.000 years, probably more.
:::
::: {.column width="45%"}
### Visual Abstraction

But data visualization requires some level of visual abstraction. We are not only drawing what we can see about the world. We are representing data visually, using abstract rules to draw something that did not exist before, and to leverage our visual perception to understand something that wasn't visual before.
:::
::::

## But...

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="45%"}

Visual and graphical representation of phenomena and data that are not inherently visual, existed well before the statistical diagrams of William Playfair. Can you think of some?

*In [ancient Babylonia](https://en.Wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonia), maps were accurately drawn on clay tablets.*

Is a map an abstraction? One have to argue that what's represented in a map is definitely observable in real life, at least in theory. Though, very few of the people drawing maps had the chance to. They relied on measurements and data, representing them on the Cartesian plane.

## The Century of Science

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="45%"}

In the 17^th^ Century, interest for the natural sciences and disciplines such as astronomy, geography, physics, demographic, grew exponentially.

In that period, data visualization as we know i, was born under the name of "Statistical Diagrams".

## Two Builing Blocks

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}

### Geometry and Coordinates

Analytical Geometry started with the work on the [Cartesian System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system).

In a plane, the Cartesian system is a coordinate system that specifies each point univocally as a pair of real numbers, the distances from two perpendicular axes.

It was invented in parallel by Descartes and Fermat in 17^th^ century.
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}

### Probablility and Statistics

When people started to look with growing interest to the natural sciences a question rose: how can we improve our measurements? What can we expect from them.

Like this, [statistical approaches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_statistics) were deployed first to reduce measurement errors in empirical measurements from Tycho Brahe. At the same time, Pascal and Fermat developed the first [probability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability#History).

LONGITUDINAL DISTANCE TOLEDO-ROME

:::

::: {.column width="30%"}

*This [Longitudinal Distance Chart](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Grados_de_la_Longitud.jpg) represents separate measurements of the distance between Toledo and Rome. Each measurement is a labelled point on a x-axis of a one-dimensional chart. All measurements overestimate the real distance, which is at ~16˚.*

:::
::: {.column width="30%"}

This chart contains so many ideas and concepts at once. The idea that measurements contain an error, that they can be repeated and pooled to infer this error, that they can be represented graphically to inspect this error using visual perception. 

The x-axis is well defined and labelled, the points show each single measurement, and are labelled also, the title is inserted in the empty space.

Author: [Johann Heinrich Lambert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Heinrich_Lambert)

*The temperature is represented on the x axis, while the y axis represents the month of the year. Lambert binned the data by this two variables, and counted how many days fell into each bin.*

Lambert positioned number in space based on the mappings of the x and y axis. Today we are used to map a color intensity to the count numeric value, in what would become a heatmap.

## The Golden Age


:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="45%"}

In the 19^th^ century, statistics took a key role in science, economics and policy making.

This is a golden age for data visualization, in which imaginative, beautiful, informative charts were produced to foster progress and decision making.

RADIAL HISTOGRAM

Year: 1858

Author: [Florence Nightingale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Nightingale).

*Nightingale used [this radial stacked histogram](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Nightingale-mortality.jpg) to show hospital death causes in the Crimean war of 1854-1855*

Aimed a the Queen Victoria and policy makers, this chart showed a peak of deaths from infectious diseases (light blue) during winter months in military hospitals. Florence Nightingale regarded these deaths as preventable, and used this chart to argue for the need of basic sanitation practices, such as air circulation.

## From 1900 On

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}

In the first half of the 20th century, data visualization was relegated to a secondary role to numerical statistical summaries.

In the second half of the century, instead, John Tukey revived it. Until today, graphics remained one of the main tool in the hand of data analysts.

:::

:::

## From 1900 On

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}

Today, with the web based resurgence of graphics and typography, data visualization is a scientific tool, a form of communication and a form of art.

:::

::::

## Visual Communication

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}

Visual communication is the oldest form of graphical communication. It predates phonemes and other abstract forms of writing.

Visual communication is a powerful tool for storytelling, it's intuitive, and it relies on our skills to process broad visual inputs quickly and in parallel.

:::
::: {.column width="45%"}

Since visual communication is intuitive, it delivers (almost) immediate messages. This immediacy makes it potentially misleading. The responsibility for making it clear and not ambiguous is yours (the author).

Data visualization is a part of the broader discipline of visual and graphical communication. Let this whole field inspire you.
